# wire-ios-protos

This framework is part of Wire iOS SyncEngine. Additional documentation is available in the [Wire iOS wiki](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/wiki).

The wire-ios-protos framework contains precompiled protocol buffer definitions for Swift.

## How to build

This framework is using Carthage to manage its dependencies. To pull the dependencies binaries, `run carthage bootstrap --platform ios`.

You need the Swift Protocol Buffer compiler  to build the protobuf Swift files. Run `brew install swift-protobuf` to install it.

Run `bash Scripts/compile-protos.sh` to generate the files from the protobuf definitions imported from Carthage.

You can now open the Xcode project and build.
